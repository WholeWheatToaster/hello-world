"Whole Wheat Toast" was my wedding toast. 
I married into a Cuban family and had been referred to as White Bread. 
Being decendant of native american, scotch, irish - definately not white bread. 
This with not being burned by marraige - WholeWheatToast. 
Now 34 years later; not burned, just crispy. ;-)
